      <p className="essential__content-text">
        Whether you are a small startup, or a Fortune 500 company, market knowledge is vital to your business success, and it can be achieved through market research surveys.
        There are 2 types of market research surveys, primary and secondary research.
        <br />
        <br />
        Primary research surveys: Surveys done by you, based on your needs and criteria, to find market insights especially for your business.
        <br />
        <br />
        Secondary research surveys: Collecting survey insights from other peopleâ€™s surveys. This improves data variety but might not apply to your business 100%.

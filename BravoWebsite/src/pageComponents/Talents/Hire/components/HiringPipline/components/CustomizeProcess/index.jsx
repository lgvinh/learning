          bravoTALENTS is built with a default hiring pipeline
          including all the normal recruiting stages.
          This is what most companies are familiar with.
          However, we understand that your job position might
          need a specific pipeline that works only for you.
          Hence, we give you the option to customize your own
          hiring pipeline to maximize you and your teamâ€™s hiring process.

      <p className="clause">1.1. Access and Use. </p>
      <p>
        Subject to payment of all applicable fees set forth in the Order or payment in accordance
        with an Indirect Order through bravoSUITE’s Authorized Channel Partners (as appropriate) and
        the terms and conditions of this Agreement, bravoSUITE grants Customer, during the
        Subscription Term, a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access and use (and permit
        Authorized Users to access and use) the SaaS Products and applicable Documentation solely
        for Customer’s and its Affiliates’ internal business purposes in accordance with the
        Documentation and in the quantity specified in the applicable Order. Customer will operate
        the SaaS Products in accordance with the Documentation and be responsible for the acts and
        omissions of its Authorized Users.
      </p>
      <p className="clause">1.2. Access and Use Restrictions.</p>
      <p>
        Customer shall not (directly or indirectly): (i) remove any notice of proprietary rights
        from the SaaS Products; (ii) modify or reverse engineer any part of the SaaS Products;
        (iii) except to the limited extent applicable laws specifically prohibit such restriction,
        decompile, attempt to derive the source code or underlying ideas or algorithms of any part
        of the SaaS Products, attempt to recreate the SaaS Products or use the SaaS Products for
        any competitive purpose; (iv) copy, modify, translate or otherwise create derivative works
        of any part of the SaaS Products; (v) sell, resell, encumber, rent, lease, time-share,
        distribute, transfer or otherwise use or exploit or make available any of the SaaS Products
        to or for the benefit of any third party; (vi) use the SaaS Products to infringe on the
        Intellectual Property rights, publicity rights, or privacy rights of any third party, or to
        store defamatory, trade libelous, or otherwise unlawful data; or (vii) send, store or
        process in the SaaS Products any personal health data, credit card data, personal financial
        data or other such sensitive data which may be, without limitation, subject to the Health
        Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or the Payment Card
        Industry Data Security Standards, or any data that is subject to the International Traffic
        in Arms Regulations maintained by the United States Department of State. Customer’s
        authorized use of the SaaS Products is subject to the purchased quantities and features set
        forth in the applicable Order for the SaaS Products. Fees for the SaaS Products are based
        on use of the SaaS Products in a manner consistent with the Documentation. If Customer’s
        usage is in a manner outside of the Documentation, then Customer will cooperate with
        bravoSUITE to address any applicable burden on the SaaS Products or pay an additional
        mutually agreed upon fee.
      </p>
      <p className="clause">1.3. Login Access to the SaaS Products.</p>
      <p>
        Customer is solely responsible for ensuring: (i) that only appropriate Authorized Users
        have access to the SaaS Products, (ii) that such Authorized Users have been trained in
        proper use of the SaaS Products, and (iii) proper usage of passwords, tokens and access
        procedures with respect to logging into the SaaS Products. bravoSUITE reserves the right to
        refuse registration of, or to cancel, login IDs that it reasonably believes to violate the
        terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, in which case bravoSUITE will promptly
        inform Customer in writing of such refusal or cancellation.
      </p>
      <p className="clause">1.4. Trial Services. </p>
      <p>
        If Customer is using a free trial, a proof of concept version of the SaaS Products, a beta
        version of the SaaS Products, or using the SaaS Products on any other free-of-charge basis
        as specified in an Order including any related support services to the extent provided by
        bravoSUITE in its sole discretion (collectively,
        {' '}
        <span className="bold">“Trial Services”</span>
        {' '}
        ), bravoSUITE makes such
        Trial Services available to Customer until the earlier of (i) the
        end of the free trial or proof of concept period or beta testing period as communicated by
        bravoSUITE or specified
        in an Order, (ii) the start date of any purchased version of such SaaS Products, or (iii)
        written notice of termination from bravoSUITE (
        {' '}
        <span className="bold">“Trial Services Period”</span>
        {' '}
        ). bravoSUITE grants
        Customer, during the Trial Services Period, a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to
        access and use the Trial Services for Customer’s internal evaluation purposes in accordance
        with the Documentation and subject to the access and use restrictions set forth in this
        Agreement. Customer is authorized to use Trial Services only for evaluation and not for any
        business or productive purposes, unless otherwise authorized by bravoSUITE in writing. Any
        data Customer enters into the Trial Services and any configurations made to the Trial
        Services by or for Customer during the term of such Trial Services will be permanently lost
        unless Customer (a) has purchased a subscription to the same SaaS Products as covered by
        the Trial Services or (b) exports such data or configurations before the end of such free
        period. There is no guarantee that features or functions of the Trial Services will be
        available, or if available will be the same, in the general release version of the SaaS
        Products, and Customer should review the SaaS Products features and functions before making
        a purchase. bravoSUITE will be under no obligation to provide Customer any maintenance or
        support services with respect to the Trial Services. Notwithstanding anything to the
        contrary, bravoSUITE provides the Trial Services “as is” and “as available” without any
        warranties or representations of any kind. To the extent permitted by law, bravoSUITE
        disclaims all implied warranties and representations, including, without limitation, any
        implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.
        Customer assumes all risks and all costs associated with its use of the Trial Services.
        Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy in case of any dissatisfaction or bravoSUITE’s breach
        of the Agreement with respect to such Trial Services is termination of the Trial Services.
        Any obligations on behalf of bravoSUITE to indemnify, defend, or hold harmless under this
        Agreement are not applicable to Customers using Trial Services.
      </p>
      <p className="clause">1.5. Third Party Materials.</p>
      <p>
        The SaaS Products include open source software programs that are made available by third
        parties under their respective open source licenses as indicated in the Documentation (
        <span className="bold">“Third Party Materials”</span>
        {' '}
        and
        {' '}
        <span className="bold">
          “OSS
          Licenses”
        </span>
        , respectively). bravoSUITE warrants that such Third Party Materials will not
        diminish the rights provided to Customer herein, or limit Customer’s ability to use the SaaS
        Products in accordance with the Documentation, or create any obligation on the part of
        Customer to license Customer’s software or products under any open source or similar
        license. Nothing herein shall derogate from mandatory rights Customer may have under any
        OSS Licenses,
        if any.
      </p>
      <p className="clause">1.6.  Support</p>
      <p>
        As part of its provision of the SaaS Products, bravoSUITE shall make available technical
        support to Customer in accordance with bravoSUITE’s then applicable SaaS support terms. Upon
        notification from bravoSUITE, Customer shall promptly update any locally-installed software
        agents on Customer systems that interact with the SaaS Products. Customer acknowledges and
        agrees that its failure to timely install such an update may result in disruptions to or
        failures of the SaaS Products, or suspension of Customer’s access to the SaaS Products,
        without any liability on the part of bravoSUITE to Customer.
      </p>
      <p className="clause">1.7.  Mobile Applications.</p>
      <p>
        With regard to SaaS Products that require the use of mobile applications by an Authorized
        User, Customer shall ensure that all Authorized Users promptly download and install all
        available updates for the mobile applications. Customer further acknowledges and agrees that
        the SaaS Products may not properly operate should any Authorized User fail to do so.

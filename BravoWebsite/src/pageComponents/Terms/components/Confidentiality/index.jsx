      <p className="clause">4.1.  Confidential Information.</p>
      <p>
        The Parties acknowledge that each may disclose certain valuable confidential and
        proprietary information to the other. “Confidential Information” means all information
        provided by the disclosing Party to the receiving Party concerning the disclosing Party
        or its Affiliates’ business, products or services that is not generally known to the
        public, including information relating to customers, vendors, trade secrets, prices,
        products, services, computer programs and other Intellectual Property, and any other
        information which a Party should reasonably understand to be considered Confidential
        Information whether or not such information is marked “Confidential” or contains such
        similar legend by the disclosing Party at the time of disclosure. The receiving Party may
        only use the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to fulfil the purposes of this
        Agreement. The receiving Party will protect the disclosing Party’s Confidential
        Information by using at least the same degree of care as the receiving Party uses to
        protect its own Confidential Information of a like nature (but no less than a reasonable
        degree of care) to prevent the unauthorized use, dissemination, disclosure or publication
        of such Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the receiving Party may
        disclose Confidential Information to its (and its Affiliates) employees, advisors,
        consultants, and agents on a need-to-know basis and provided that such party is bound by
        obligations of confidentiality substantially similar to those contained herein. This
        Section 4 supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous understandings and agreements,
        whether written or oral, between the Parties with respect to Confidential Information and
        is a complete and exclusive statement thereof. Additionally, the obligations set forth in
        Section 5.3 and not Section 4 herein apply to Customer Data.
      </p>
      <p className="clause">4.2.  Exceptions.</p>
      <p>
        Information will not be deemed Confidential Information if it (i) is known to the receiving
        Party prior to receipt from the disclosing Party directly or indirectly from a source other
        than one having an obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing Party, (ii) becomes
        known (independently of disclosure by the disclosing Party) to the receiving Party directly
        or indirectly from a source other than one having an obligation of confidentiality to the
        disclosing Party, (iii) becomes publicly known or otherwise ceases to be secret or
        confidential, except through a breach of this Agreement by the receiving Party, or (iv) is
        independently developed by the receiving Party without use of or reliance upon the
        disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, and the receiving Party can provide
        documentary evidence to that effect. The receiving Party may disclose Confidential
        Information pursuant to the requirements of a court, governmental agency or by operation of
        law but shall (to the extent permissible by law) limit such disclosure to only the
        information requested and give the disclosing Party prior written notice sufficient to
        permit the disclosing Party to contest such disclosure.
      </p>
      <p className="clause">4.3. Advertising and Publicity.</p>
      <p>
        Neither Party shall make or permit to be made any public announcement concerning the
        relationship between the Parties without the prior written consent of the other Party.

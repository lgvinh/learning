        the right, power or authority to obligate or bind the other in any manner whatsoever.
      </p>

      <p className="clause">13.3. Force Majeure. </p>
      <p>
        Neither Party will be liable to the other Party for any delay or failure to perform which

        terrorism, flood, lockout, transportation delay, war, acts of God, governmental rule or
        order, strikes or other labor difficulties, or other causes beyond its reasonable control.
        However, in such event, both Parties will resume performance promptly after the cause of
        such delay or failure has been removed.
      </p>
      <p className="clause">13.4. Governing Law and Jurisdiction. </p>
      <p>
        Each Party agrees to the applicable governing law below without regard to choice or
        conflicts of law rules, and to the exclusive jurisdiction of the applicable courts below
        with respect to any dispute, claim, action, suit or proceeding (including non-contractual
        disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, or its subject
        matter or formation. To the extent not prohibited by law, each of the Parties hereby
        irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out
        of or related to this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p className="clause">13.5. Entire Agreement, Execution, and Modification. </p>
      <p>
        This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and representations between the Parties
        regarding the subject matter of this Agreement. The terms and conditions contained in any
        purchase order issued by Customer will be of no force or effect, even if the order is
        accepted by bravoSUITE. bravoSUITE may make changes to these Terms of Service from time to
        time. If bravoSUITE makes a material change to any of the foregoing, bravoSUITE will inform
        Customer by e-mail to the e-mail address(es) noted on the Order (or subsequently designated
        by Customer in writing as a contact for notifications from bravoSUITE), or through a banner
        or other prominent notice within the SaaS Products, or through the bravoSUITE support
        platform. If Customer does not agree to the change, Customer must so notify bravoSUITE by
        e-mail to support@bravosuite.io within thirty (30) days after bravoSUITE’s notice. If
        Customer so notifies bravoSUITE, then Customer will remain governed by the most recent
        terms of service applicable to Customer until the end of the then-current year of the
        Subscription Term and the updated terms shall apply upon the commencement of the subsequent
        Subscription Term.
      </p>
      <p className="clause">13.6. Severability and Waiver. </p>
      <p>
        This Agreement shall be deemed severable, and the invalidity or unenforceability of any
        term or provision hereof shall not affect the validity or enforceability of this Agreement
        or of any other term or provision hereof. Should any term or provision of this Agreement be
        declared void or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the Parties intend
        that a substitute provision will be added to this Agreement that, to the greatest extent
        possible, achieves the intended commercial result of the original provision. The failure of
        either Party to enforce any rights granted to it hereunder or to take action against the
        other Party in the event of any breach hereunder will not be deemed a waiver by that Party
        as to subsequent enforcement of rights or subsequent actions in the event of future
        breaches.

      <p className="clause">3.1. Intellectual Property.</p>
      <p>
        Except for the rights granted in this Agreement, all rights, title, and interest in and
        to the SaaS Products, Documentation, and bravoSUITE Intellectual Property are hereby
        reserved by bravoSUITE, its Affiliates or licensors. Except as provided for herein, all
        rights, title, and interest in and to Customer Intellectual Property are hereby reserved
        by Customer, its Affiliates or licensors. Nothing in this Agreement shall (a) transfer
        ownership of any Intellectual Property rights from one Party to the other, or (b) provide
        either Party a right to use the other Party’s trade names, logos, or trademarks.
      </p>
      <p className="clause">3.2. Customer Data.</p>
      <p>
        Customer owns all right, title and interest in all Customer Data. Nothing in this Agreement
        shall be construed to grant bravoSUITE any rights in Customer Data beyond those expressly
        provided herein. Customer grants bravoSUITE and its Affiliates the limited, non-exclusive
        right to view and use the Customer Data solely for the purpose of providing and improving
        the SaaS Products.
      </p>
      <p className="clause">3.3. Usage Data and Suggestions.</p>
      <p>
        bravoSUITE shall be permitted to collect and use the Usage Data internally and for
        Customer’s benefit. In the event bravoSUITE wishes to disclose the Usage Data or any part
        thereof to third parties (either during the Subscription Term or thereafter), such data
        shall be anonymized and presented in the aggregate so that it will not identify Customer or
        its Authorized Users. The foregoing shall not limit in any way bravoSUITE’s confidentiality
        obligations pursuant to Section 4 below. To the extent that Customer provides bravoSUITE
        with Suggestions, such Suggestions shall be free from any confidentiality restrictions that
        might otherwise be imposed upon bravoSUITE pursuant to this Agreement, and may be
        implemented by bravoSUITE in its sole discretion. Customer acknowledges that any bravoSUITE
        products or materials incorporating any such Suggestions shall be the sole and exclusive
        property of bravoSUITE.

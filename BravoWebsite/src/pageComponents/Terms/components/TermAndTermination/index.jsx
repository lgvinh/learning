      <p className="clause">12.1. Term. </p>
      <p>
        This Agreement will be effective upon the Effective Date and shall remain in force during
        the applicable Subscription Term of the SaaS Products or unless or until terminated by
        either Party pursuant to this Section. Prior to the end of the Subscription Term, Customer
        may contact bravoSUITE to extend the term of their Subscription Term for the period stated
        in any such agreed upon renewal Order.
      </p>
      <p className="clause">12.2. Termination for Convenience. </p>
      <p>
        Either Party may terminate this Agreement, upon sixty (60) days prior written notice, for
        any reason, provided however that: (i) if bravoSUITE terminates the Agreement, it will
        refund the fees paid to it for the unused Subscription Term to the Customer, pro-rated, and
        (ii) if Customer terminates the Agreement, it shall not be entitled to any refund.
      </p>
      <p className="clause">12.3. Termination for Cause. </p>
      <p>
        Either Party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice to the other Party if the
        other Party: (i) materially breaches this Agreement and fails to remedy such breach within
        thirty (30) days after receiving written notice of the breach from the other Party, or (ii)
        commences bankruptcy or dissolution proceedings, has a receiver appointed for a substantial
        part of its assets, or ceases to operate in the ordinary course of business. In addition, a
        Party may terminate this Agreement, in whole or in part, or cease provision of SaaS
        Products if required to comply with applicable law or regulation, and such termination will
        not constitute a breach of this Agreement by the terminating Party.
      </p>
      <p className="clause">12.4. Effects of Termination/Expiration. </p>
      <p>
        Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement: (i) Customer will have no further right
        to access or use the SaaS Products; and (ii) each Party shall within thirty (30) days after
        written request return or destroy any tangible Confidential Information of the other Party
        within its possession or control that is not contained on the SaaS Products. Any Customer
        Data contained on the SaaS Products will be deleted within sixty (60) days of
        termination/expiration of Customer’s Subscription Term. Customer acknowledges that it is
        responsible for exporting any Customer Data to which Customer desires continued access
        after termination/expiration, and bravoSUITE shall have no liability for any failure of
        Customer to retrieve such Customer Data and no obligation to store or retain any such
        Customer Data after such sixty (60) day period. Following termination of the SaaS
        Products, bravoSUITE may immediately deactivate Customer’s account. Any accrued rights
        and obligations will survive termination.

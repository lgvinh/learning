      <p className="clause">6.1. SaaS Products Warranty.</p>
      <p>
        During the applicable Subscription Term, bravoSUITE warrants that the SaaS Products will
        perform in substantial conformity with the Documentation, and that the SaaS Products are
        not designed to contain viruses, worms, Trojan horses or other unintended malicious or
        destructive code. The foregoing warranties are void if the failure of the SaaS Products has
        resulted from negligence, error, or misuse of the SaaS Products by Customer, the Authorized
        User or by anyone other than bravoSUITE. Customer shall be required to report any breach of
        warranty to bravoSUITE within a period of thirty (30) days of the date on which the
        incident giving rise to the claim occurred. bravoSUITE’s sole and exclusive liability, and
        Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy, for breach of these warranties will be for
        bravoSUITE, at its expense, to use reasonable commercial efforts to correct such
        nonconformity within thirty (30) days of the date that notice of the breach was provided;
        and, if bravoSUITE fails to correct the breach within such cure period, Customer may
        terminate the affected Order and, in such event, bravoSUITE shall provide Customer with a
        pro-rata refund of any unused pre-paid fees paid for the period following termination as
        calculated on a monthly basis for the affected SaaS Products.
      </p>
      <p className="clause">6.2. Compliance with Law. </p>
      <p>
        Each Party shall comply with all applicable, laws and regulations in connection with the
        performance of its obligations and the exercise of its rights under this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p className="clause">6.3. Disclaimer. </p>
      <p>
        Any and all warranties, expressed, incorporated or implied, are limited to the extent and
        period mentioned above. To the maximum extent allowed by applicable law, bravoSUITE
        disclaims all other warranties, conditions and other terms, whether implied or incorporated
        into this Agreement by statute, common law or otherwise, including the implied conditions
        and warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. bravoSUITE will
        have no liability for delays, failures or losses attributable or related in any way to the
        use or implementation of third-party software or services not provided by bravoSUITE.
